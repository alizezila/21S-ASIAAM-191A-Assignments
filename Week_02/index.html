    <h2> Introduction </h2> 

    <p> Hi all! My name is Alize (pronounced Uh-leeze) Magaña and I'm a first-gen student in my last year and last quarter at UCLA!
    The aim of this portfolio is to display my projects from my fairly new mapping career, so please bear with me! 
    I am so excited to learn more about the intersections of GIS and civil society and I am hoping to use my skills as a mapper and advocate 
    to better work for and with marginalized, underrepresented communities. </p>

    <p> If you'd like to get to know me better, head to About Me :)</p>
    <a href="aboutme.html"> About Me </a> 

    
    <p> I am a born and raised Los Angeles resident and I've witnessed first-hand
    the devastating effects of houselessness in LA, home to the nation's 2nd largest homeless population. (CITE)
    Safe-parking sites are designated sites for vehicle-dewlling individuals, who represent over 25% of the population of 
    people experiencing homelessness in LA County. Safe-parking sites protect vehicle-dwellers by providing safe places to park while remaining compliant with local laws.
    Below is a map I made that marks LAHSA sponsored safe-parking locations in Los Angeles County. </p>
