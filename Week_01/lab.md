WHAT FIELDS I USED -

'ASIAN_POP' & 'TOTAL_POP'
Total number of Asian people in a given county and total number of people in a given county

WHY I USED THESE FIELDS -
I created a new field titled AsianPop% that calculated the percent of the total population that is made up by Asian residents. 
("ASIAN_POP" / "TOTAL_POP") x 100

Given the abhorrent attacks on the Asian community across America recently, I was interested to seeing how the Asian community is populated across California. In some counties, the Asian population falls under 2% though in larger counties like San Francisco and Alameda county, the Asian population makes up over 30% of the total population. This is important to know to be able to mark where the attacks are happening and if they are happening in places with very little or very large Asian populations. 

WHAT PROBLEMS COULD THE DATA SET HAVE -
When surveying data, one must be aware that the data could represent another persons biases and presumptions, and acknowledge that this data by itself lacks other details that may better contextualize it. For the new field I created, the Asian population could fall close to 1% which can be jarring at first look but it is important to recognize some of those counties are not very populated and the number of Asian residents could fall closer to the population of other minority groups in the same county.
